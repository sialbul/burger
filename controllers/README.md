# EAT the BURGER

* Eat the Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Cutlery! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* The app store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


I created the app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. 

## Demo
*Eat the Burger* is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out [here.](https://boiling-lake-37451.herokuapp.com/)
